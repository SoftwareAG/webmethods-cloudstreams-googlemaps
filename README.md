# webMethods CloudStreams Provider for Google Maps
This project provides a sample webMethods CloudStreams Provider Project for Google Maps. The following APIs are available:
* **Directions:** The Google Maps Directions API is a service that calculates directions between locations. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions
* **Distance matrix**: The Google Maps Distance Matrix API is a service that provides travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations, based on the recommended route between start and end points. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix
* **Elevation**: The Google Maps Elevation API provides elevation data for all locations on the surface of the earth, including depth locations on the ocean floor (which return negative values). https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation
* **Geocode**: The Google Maps Geocoding API is a service that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding of addresses. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding
* **Gelocation**: The Google Maps Geolocation API returns a location and accuracy radius based on information about cell towers and WiFi nodes that the mobile client can detect. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation
* **Timezone**:The Google Maps Time Zone API provides time offset data for locations on the surface of the earth. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/timezone

## Requirements

The project was developed and tested on the following installation:
1. Integration Server 9.12
2. CloudStreams Server 9.12
3. Software AG Designer 9.12 with Service Development and CloudStreams Development

## Quick start

To install the project on your local development environment follow these steps.

### Prepare CloudStreams connection

1. In Software AG Designer open ```Window > Preferences```.
2. Navigate to ```Software AG > CloudStreams Servers```.
3. Add your local Integration Server. If there is already an entry make sure username and password are correct by clicking the Test button.

### Import CloudStreams Provider Project

1. In Software AG Designer switch to the ```CloudStreams Development``` perspective.
2. Select File > Import and choose ```Software AG > CloudStreams Provider Project```. Click Next.
3. Select the root of this repository as the Root Directory.
4. Select the ```Google Maps``` project.
5. Check ```Copy project into workspace```.
6. Click Finish.
7. Expand the newly imported project.
8. Right-click ```com.softwareag.googleMaps``` and select Deploy.

### Import Integration Server packages
The CloudStreams Provider Project does not contain neccessary doctypes.

1. Copy GoogleMaps.zip and GoogleMapsTests.zip to ```<install_dir>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instance>/replicate/inbound```.
2. Open Integration Server Administration in your browser.
3. Install both packages with ```Install Inbound Releases``` in Package Management.

### Add Google API Key and activate connections

To access Google APIs an API key is neccessary. Generate your API key here: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials. Make sure all Google Maps APIs are enabled in your library by clicking and enabling each of them (https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library).

1. Open Integration Server Administration in your browser.
2. Navigate to ```Solutions > CloudStreams > Providers > GoogleMaps```.
3. Select ```GoogleMaps``` from the Connector List.

You will find two (disabled) connections: GoogleMapsTest:apiConnection and GoogleMapsTest:mapsConnection. You need to modify both connections:
1. Click the Edit button of the connection.
2. Enter your Google API key in APIKey-field and save the changes.
3. Enable the connection.

### Run tests

1. In Software AG Designer switch to the ```Service Development``` perspective.
2. Expand the ```GoogleMapsTests``` package.
3. Run the ```*Test``` flow services you find in the subsequent directories.
